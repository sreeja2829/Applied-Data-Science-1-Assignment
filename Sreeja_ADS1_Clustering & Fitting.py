Output Discussion:
Mean: Average age and billing amount.
Variance: Spread of data points.
Skewness: Asymmetry in the distribution (e.g., positive skew for billing amounts).
Kurtosis: Tailedness (e.g., high kurtosis indicates outliers in billing amounts).

Discussion of Results

Statistical Moments: The analysis of statistical moments highlighted key measures 
of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, range) for 
critical variables such as Age, Billing Amount, and Length of Stay. 
These insights helped in understanding the distribution and variability of patient data.

Visualizations:

Scatter Plot: The scatter plot between Age and Billing Amount indicated no strong correlation,
suggesting that patient age alone is not a significant predictor of billing costs.

Bar Chart: A bar chart analysis of medical conditions by Admission Type revealed that 
conditions such as Cancer and Diabetes were prevalent across multiple admission categories, 
with some conditions being more frequent in emergency cases.

Heatmap: The correlation heatmap illustrated weak relationships among numerical features,
reinforcing the idea that no single variable strongly influences another. However, minor 
positive and negative associations were observed, which could guide further investigation.

Clustering: Through clustering analysis, distinct patient groups were identified based on
their spending patterns and age. This segmentation provided insights into different categories
of patients, potentially helping in targeted healthcare interventions or policy decisions.

Regression: Regression analysis demonstrated a weak predictive relationship between Age 
and Billing Amount, implying that additional factorsâ€”such as type of treatment, severity of
condition, or insurance coverage likely play a more significant role in determining 
healthcare costs. This finding underscores the need for a more complex predictive model
incorporating multiple variables.
